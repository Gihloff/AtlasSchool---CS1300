        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>My name is Gabe Ihloff, I am 25 years old from Tulsa Oklahoma. I am a tier 1 programming student 
             currently studying Machine Learning at Atlas School.</p>
        <h3>Why I chose the tech field -</h3>
        <p>I've taken great interests in electronics and software since I was a kid, always curious about their inner workings.
             Around 14 years old I built my first gaming pc, and loved the whole process from learning about each of the parts
             and how they interact with each other, to setting up the software and getting into the nitty gritty of the bios.
             I have been enamored with tech since, and that has only grown throughout my STEM studies in high school and college.</p>
        <h3>Why I chose Atlas School -</h3>
        <p>Atlas School caught my interests due to the smaller and more inteactive class sizes, the accelerated and career-focused coursework,
            and beacuse of its mission statement to help grow the tech industry of Tulsa. Ive always had an interests in software development, 
            and have spent all of my life in Tulsa, so for me seemed like a perfect opportunity to increase my skillset in the tech field 
            while helping grow the tech industry in my hometown</p>
        <h3>What spec I chose at Atlas School -</h3>
        <p>I chose to spec into Machine Learning for my coursework at Atlas School. I felt like this spec when compared to others offered here, 
            fits my educational background best. I have a long history of learning and working in STEM and believe that the engineering development 
            skills I've gained will translate nicely to Machine Learning. The idea of building new and cutting edge software is exciting to me!</p>
