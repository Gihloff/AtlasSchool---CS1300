Github:
-Go over Github actions and commands. Make sure you understand organization and different commands needed for course.
-We will be using github for assignments, make sure to be uploading to the class repo.

-Look into Docker for learning more about setting up and using virtual machines. (Dev Containers)
    -Can be used to share the same "workspace" between machines (Home PC and laptop).
    -Helps keep the same environment on different machines for the same project. Sometimes a project may not run as inteded in a different
    workspace due to versions, or other specifics that were setup in the original environment.
    -Docker helps to share the same environment "settings" across multiple devices or workspaces.
